      <h3> Cambridge Computing Museum </h3>
      <p> Visiting the computing museum was very interesting and I learnt more about how computers have evolved over the years. We also got to play some super retro games and find our houses on a map program on a floppy disk that ran on a computer from the 80s.</p>
